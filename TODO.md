Issues:
- Catching:
- - Successive SUCCESS and FLED messages
- Pokemon Management
- - Incorrect evolution messages
- - Running concurrently with other Pokemon Management calls when short distances between waypoints

Item Management:
- ~~Inventory management~~
- ~~Drop certain items on pickup (configurable)~~

Egg Management:
- Determine when eggs are obtained
- Record hatched pokemon
- Incubate eggs based on longest distance

Pokemon Management:
- When recycling, calculate how many should remain for evolution targets
- Use Lucky Egg prior to evolving pokemon
- Fix evolution logic (can potentially keep evolving first form pokemon instead of available second form)
- Trim high CP low rarity pokemon (Pinsirs)
- Implement Pokemon Management strategies

Movement:
- ~~Sweep target areas~~
- Hover around heavily lured areas?

Player Metrics:
- ~~Record Pokemon Caught/Hatched/Evolved~~
- Record Distance Walked
- Record Levels Gained

Automation: 
- Exit upon milestone completion
  - Distance Walked
  - XP Gained
  - Pokemon Caught
- Take 5 minute breaks after 1 hr

Luxuries:
- Pokemon Hunting Mode (For rarity)
- Need to wait between requests made not between logic (Pokemon Management can take a long time)
